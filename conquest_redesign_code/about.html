			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<div class="page_intro">
				<p><span>Conquest Brewing Company is the embodiment of an idea.</span> The idea that beer should be more than a beverage, more than an alcohol delivery system. The idea that the long, painful history of mankind has many common threads woven throughout it, and one of these threads is beer. While it is arguably not the most important thread of civilization, it is one of the chief building blocks thereof.</p>

					<p>Conquest Brewing Company is the embodiment of an idea. The idea that beer should be more than a beverage, more than an alcohol delivery system. The idea that the long, painful history of mankind has many common threads woven throughout it, and one of these threads is beer. While it is arguably not the most important thread of civilization, it is one of the chief building blocks thereof.</p>
					<blockquote>History is written by the victor.</blockquote>
					<p>We at Conquest Brewing Company continue the proud tradition of so many saints and vagabonds, lords and serfs before us: the tradition of crafting, and enjoying, the most complex and inviting, the most approachable and esoteric beverages the world has ever known.</p>
					<p>Our beers pay homage to bygone times of war and peace, to tales both fantastic and dreadfully real. We believe that the onward march of history will show that in the end, honor is what makes a man, and taste is what makes a beer-- not marketing, not hype. Taste. And we do not intend to be lost to the annals of history.</p>

						<h5>Matthew Ellisor</h5>
						<h6>Vice President  &  Assistant Brewer</h6>
						<p>We like to call Matthew our "chief zymurgical operative." With an extensive background and understanding of microbiology, chemistry, and physics, Matthew is in charge of biological quality control and yeast handling during our brewing process. A native of Columbia, Matthew has only ever moved a few blocks from his birthplace. In the top of his high school-level honors classes in biology, chemistry and physics, completed by the ripe age of 15, Matthew went on to independently study the sciences as well as receive formal education in brewing technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology. He can be found wielding a mash paddle, tinkering with equipment, or getting caught up in technical brewing conversations in the tasting room.</p>

						<h5>Joseph Ackerman</h5>
						<h6>President  &  Head Brewer</h6>
						<p>A native of Columbia, Joseph actually grew up a few blocks from Matthew, though they didn't meet until they began science classes together in high school. Joseph became interested in brewing while studying English at the University of South Carolina. His first attempted brew was in a friend's apartment complex in a coffee pot... and though the results were disastrous, it piqued his interest. He began brewing extract batches and became heavily involved in the Palmetto State Brewer's Association, a local homebrewing club, where he and Matthew renewed their friendship and began brewing together. Matthew won a used mash tun in a raffle, and they began all-grain brewing in Joseph's carport in early 2008, and never looked back. Joseph can be found waxing verbose in beer descriptions or wearing his daughters on his back while brewing, but only ever doing one thing at a time.</p>
